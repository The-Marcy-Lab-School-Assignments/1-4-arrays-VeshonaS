# Question
Check out [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) for this question.

What's the difference between the spread operator and the rest operator?

# Answer
Rest parameters are what is used to allow multiple sets of arguments being passed into a function and gives an array of the arguments passed. The spread operator is used to "unpack" non-iterable data such as strings and arrays.

# Teacher Feedback

I think you have it backwards here, rest parameters is what is used in the parameters to grab all of the contents being passed into the function and makes it into an array like data structure and the spread operator will make a copy of an already existing array or string.
